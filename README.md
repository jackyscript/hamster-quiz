## Background
Created for a special person and family member. Quiz is written in German language as it is dedicated for that person.

Hamster quiz is built upon the implementation of "How to Make a Simple JavaScript Quiz":
https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/

It is extended by a special emoji puzzle after solving all quiz questions.

The quiz is about hamsters, apparently.
